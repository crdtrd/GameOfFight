The external file format is json, using key-pair values. Should be fairly easy to edit, in-case you wanted your character to have like $10000 or something. Thanks for playing.
If you want to see the file system in action, you can delete the player_data folder if you want. It makes a new one if there isn't one there.
I believe right now the game may crash if your power level is too high, since item tiers are decided by your power level, and when the shop tries to reference a tier that is too high and doesn't exist, yeah that's not gonna work out.
